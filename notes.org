* Speeding up startup
** via byte-compiling elisp
*** straight already byte-compiles all the deps, which is great
*** I tried byte-compiling my own cfg/* files and it was a disaster, got frustrated and gave up
*** not sure this is the best approach anyway
** other ideas for speeding it up
*** this crazy CRIU thing is a way to snapshot/restore an entire process's state:
    * https://criu.org/Usage_scenarios#Slow-boot_services_speed_up
    * so use that ^ and script something to rebuild the snapshot prior to the next launch if cfg has changed
      * IOW, do something like storing a snapshot with a git SHA, never touch emacs cfg without committing (to a temp working branch which I squash-merge)
      * instead of launching emacs directly:
        * wrapper script checks SHA and if it does not match then
          * launch emacs normally, when it is done loading init.el then CRIU snapshot it...
        * if it does match then do the fast-path with CRIU snap
          * but what about CLI args?

**** works and is stupidly fast
     * does not support X
     * but emacs --daemon is simple to CRIU
     * but I don't want just one, shared state across all is too cumbersome
     * emacs --bg-daemon=ropes ; criu it ; start that when launching ropes ctx ; use emacsclient from then on
     * https://criu.org/Simple_loop (have to use sudo, at least for dump)
     * with this it is very very fast to launch a client

** whoa
   /home/blake/bin/emacs --batch --load ~/.emacs.d/init.el --execute '(dump-emacs "myemacs" "/home/blake/bin/emacs")'
   * except this didn't work
* Interesting emacs integrations to try

  * https://gitlab.com/iankelling/spray <-- speed reading

* press keys and get equivalent elisp (or, from a macro)
