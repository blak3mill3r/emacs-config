* Speeding up startup
** via byte-compiling elisp
*** straight already byte-compiles all the deps, which is great
*** I tried byte-compiling my own cfg/* files and it was a disaster, got frustrated and gave up
*** not sure this is the best approach anyway
** other ideas for speeding it up
*** this crazy CRIU thing is a way to snapshot/restore an entire process's state:
    * https://criu.org/Usage_scenarios#Slow-boot_services_speed_up
    * so use that ^ and script something to rebuild the snapshot prior to the next launch if cfg has changed
      * IOW, do something like storing a snapshot with a git SHA, never touch emacs cfg without committing (to a temp working branch which I squash-merge)
      * instead of launching emacs directly:
        * wrapper script checks SHA and if it does not match then
          * launch emacs normally, when it is done loading init.el then CRIU snapshot it...
        * if it does match then do the fast-path with CRIU snap
          * but what about CLI args?

* Interesting emacs integrations to try
  * https://github.com/Silex/docker.el
  * https://github.com/vermiculus/magithub
  * https://gitlab.com/iankelling/spray <-- speed reading

* press keys and get equivalent elisp (or, from a macro)
  * https://github.com/Silex/elmacro

* fun stuff

* GIT, magit, things to improve:
