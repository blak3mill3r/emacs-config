* need scripts/criu-ns from criu-dev branch
* when I had it working it was with v3.9 (latest release)
  * but I had to grab scripts/criu-ns from criu-dev branch

* then it stopped working at some point and I think I've tracked down why
  * this systemd socket thing emacs has
  * don't recall rebuilding emacs but maybe I did...
  * anyway it has this fancy systemd socket garbage that makes criu dump fail

* try with ./configure --disable-libsystemd
  * tried and failed with ./configure --without-libsystemd
  * which still fucking linked with libsystemd (which is lame)


* FIXED IT
** damnit
*** fuck you systemd

*** disabled and masked and killed journald and it all works again
*** at what point did my debian stretch system start running journald for me? FUCK
